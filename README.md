========
### This program is designed for my personal use only. In the future it may be generalized to help others to manage their ebooks.
Developer's Note
----------------
- This program is written purely in JAVA on Windows 10 with java 1.8.0_181.
Limitations
-----------
- This program is not written to support OS other than Windows 10.
- Fatal bugs are still present in the codes so compilation is very likely to fail.
- Compatibility is an important issue as the release preview1.0 only works on my PC. This release was created in 2016 before I put the code aside for 2 years.
Future Plan
-----------
- In the near future this program is only expected to have simple GUI compatible of Win10, and be released in jar format. More fancy GUI and exe release are not in my plan yet due to the lack of time.
- A greedy thought would be transplanting the program to a web application running on a server.
Everyone is welcome to raise an issue to help me improve the code:smile:
